The aim of the project is to create an interactive website that connects the campground owners and travelers without any external agent and hours of searching and bargaining. 
•	The site gives the owners authority to add their campgrounds with their location and full details. 
•	This submission will automatically generate a world map with that pin point location along with thousands of others campgrounds. 
•	This also gives the user authority to view a campground, view or add a review according to his experience. User can also search campgrounds by clicking on specified location of that campground in world map. 
•	Only the owner can edit or delete its campground and similarly only a user can delete or edit his own review.
•	Every user must have to be logged in or registered (for new users) for adding reviews, campgrounds on the site. 
•	Similarly, the owner of any campground cannot add, edit or delete any review on his campground as it provides an unbiased view of every campground. 
•	Any user or owner cannot delete the review or campgrounds of any other user or owner as the site holds the basic feature of copyrights for every user. 
•	We also added a world map with the locations of all campgrounds located on it calculated through longitude and latitude. A touch on these locations opens up the show page for campgrounds which give a detailed view of a particular campground. 

The site provides all the basic features of professionally built web apps and is ready to update and fix any bugs which makes this app much better and real-world oriented.
